The task involves manufacturing n distinct toys, each associated with a specific profit and subject to production constraints. Additionally, there is an option to sell special packages containing three different toys, each with its specific profit. The objective is to maximize the total profit, considering production constraints, to optimize the company's performance during the festive season.

The solution is formulated as a linear programming problem using the PuLP library in Python, based on the information provided in the input file.
